# Dataloader Workshop

Follow these steps:
1. Run `yarn install`
2. Look at the naive version of the pizza loading application in `pizza.js`. Run it with `node pizza.js`. How is the performance/efficiency with respect to reading in data?
3. Try to improve the performance using the `dataloader` package. Can you reduce the number of csv read operations down from 9?
4. Look at the solution that uses `dataloader` in `pizza-v2.js`. Run it with `node pizza-v2.js`. How does it compare with your solution?
